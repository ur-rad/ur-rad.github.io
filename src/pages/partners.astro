        <p class="text-md mb-3">
          Quori is a not-for-profit open-source, modular, social robot platform
          for the human-robot interaction (HRI) research community.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md mb-3">
          Quori has been in development for 10 years now, with the first 10
          Quori 1.0 units distributed to 10 collaborative research teams (35
          labs across 11 universities) across the United States. Quori 1.0 was
          deployed in a variety of real-world settings, including the
          Philadelphia Museum of Art, where it autonomously interacted with
          183,000+ museum visitors in a 6-month live exhibit.
        </p>

        <p class="text-md mb-3">
          We recently received additional funding for the development of Quori
          2.0, an enhanced redesign to serve as a general-purpose, open platform
          for the HRI research community. This effort includes the manufacturing
          and distribution of 50 Quori 2.0 robots to sites around the world.
          Quori 2.0 is being developed by collaborators from Oregon State
          University, the University of Pennsylvania, Semio Community, OLogic,
          and IK Studio.

          Why Partner with UR-RAD?
        </p>
        <p class="text-md mb-3">
          At UR-RAD 2025, the Quori team is looking for feedback from the
          robotics community to help make the Quori platform even better!
        </p><p class="text-md mb-3">
          We seek to gather the existing US-based Quori 1.0 community, and
          expand it globally in a Quori 2.0 community that includes robotics
          researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and the public
          sector.
        </p><p class="text-md mb-3">
          The new Quori website/platform is currently in development, and
          conversations at the UR-RAD symposium will help guide its contents.

          stating that you would like for your contribution (paper title and ID)

        <p class="mb-3">
          Of particular relevance to the Quori community, UR-RAD emphasizes how
          human-robot interactions can be captured as computational artifacts,
          or representations. For social robots like Quori, this includes social
          behavior representations, multi-layered authoring architectures,
          end-user programming tools, and more. Specifically, the Quori
          community is interested in topics and representations of speech-based
          behaviors including linguistics (speech recognition, text-to-speech,
          syntax of language, etc.) and vocalics (volume, pitch, rate, etc.), as
          well as body language-based behaviors, including proxemics (social
          spacing), haptics (touch), oculesics (eye gaze), kinesics (face, hand,
          and body gestures), deixis (spatial referencing), and chronemics
          (turn-taking and back-channeling). Thinking critically about these
          representations is essential to shaping Quori and the next generation
          of social robot platforms.

          Many of UR-RADâ€™s topics of interest are deeply aligned with the Quori
          community. We welcome paper submissions (long, short, or
