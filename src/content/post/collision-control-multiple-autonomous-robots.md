title: "A Discussion on the Collision Control of Multiple Autonomous Robots"
abstract: "This paper discusses control methods for multi-agent autonomous robots subject to collision avoidance and unknown external forcing. Emphasis is focused on presenting control approaches based purely on stabilizing the active constraints that the robots are subjected to. The performance of three different constraint formulations are compared for a worst-case collision avoidance scenario for two robots. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate good computation simplicity/efficiency and robustness to unknown external disturbances."
