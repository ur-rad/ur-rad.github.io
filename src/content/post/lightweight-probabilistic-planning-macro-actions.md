title: "Lightweight Probabilistic Planning with Macro Actions"
abstract: "In assigning task goals to a robot, the locations of objects relevant to these goals may not be known beforehand. Off-the-shelf probabilistic planning approaches can then be used to generate a policy for achieving these goals. If these approaches are run online, the robot can continuously plan and re-plan during the execution of its task. Unfortunately, online probabilistic planning requires substantial compute resources like time and memory. In cases where the planner must run onboard a consumer robot (e.g., in a household) or in isolated environments (e.g., onboard a ship), the robot may lack sufficient compute resources for online probabilistic planning, thereby necessitating the development of more lightweight solutions. In this paper, we describe our in-progress research on PUMA, a lightweight variant of the PO-UCT probabilistic planning algorithm that modifies the PO-UCT search tree representation to include macro actions. Macro actions compress deterministic branches of the search tree, which speed up search, though at the expense of the algorithmâ€™s ability to guarantee convergence to an optimal solution."
