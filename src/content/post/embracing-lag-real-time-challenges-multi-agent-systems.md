title: "Embracing the Lag: Real-Time Challenges in Multi-Agent Systems"
abstract: "In the dynamic world of distributed multi-agent systems, where agents collaborate, coordinate, and make decisions in real time, the concept of 'lag' poses a formidable challenge. As these autonomous entities interact across vast networks, communication delays and latency inevitably arise, impacting the system's correctness. It is this inherent problem against the ticking clock that drives our research. Consider the arenas of distributed video games, self-driving vehicles, and online trading and auction systems. Each of these is impacted by latency. While there are several methods employed to combat the effects of latency in these arenas, it is notable that latency itself is not explicitly accounted for, particularly in POMDP models. We argue that latency needs to be modeled."
