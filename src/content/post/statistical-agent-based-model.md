title: "A Statistical Agent-Based Model Of Development And Evaluation"
abstract: "This paper describes a prospective, preference-driven, practical model that may have useful systems engineering applications. This paper begins by describing the model’s mindbody-environment (MBE) conceptual foundation and continues with an overview of how each MBE component can be represented. In brief, the model assumes that a system can be assembled/composed from constituent parts with appropriate tools. An environment can be represented by the set of all possible composition options. A mind can be represented by a network of parts and tools animated by algorithms that guide composition. A body can be represented as that portion of the environment that a mind can directly control to affect other portions of the environment. The practical model is a software implementation of these representations. Finally, this paper describes the further work needed to advance the model."
