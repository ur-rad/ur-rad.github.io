## Abstract

We present a novel framework for grounding complex natural language commands that specify temporal constraints in previously unseen environments. Our approach combines compositional semantic parsing with temporal logic representations to enable robots to understand and execute commands such as "Pick up the red block, then place it on the blue surface, but only after the green light turns on." The system demonstrates robust performance across diverse environments without requiring environment-specific training data.

## Introduction

Natural language represents one of the most intuitive interfaces for specifying robot tasks, yet current approaches struggle with temporal complexity and generalization to new environments. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between the compositional nature of natural language and the structured representations required for reliable robot execution.

Our work addresses this challenge by developing a representation that captures both the semantic content of natural language commands and their temporal dependencies, while maintaining sufficient abstraction to generalize across environments.

## Methodology

### Compositional Semantic Parsing

We develop a neural semantic parser that decomposes complex commands into structured representations:

1. **Entity Recognition**: Identifies objects, locations, and temporal markers
2. **Action Decomposition**: Breaks complex commands into primitive actions
3. **Temporal Constraint Extraction**: Identifies ordering, conditioning, and timing requirements
4. **Compositional Assembly**: Combines elements into executable temporal logic formulas

### Temporal Logic Representation

Commands are represented using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) extended with spatial and object-oriented predicates:

- **Atomic Propositions**: Object states, robot configurations, environmental conditions
- **Temporal Operators**: Eventually (◊), Always (□), Until (U), Next (○)
- **Spatial Predicates**: Near, On, In, Above with metric groundings
- **Conditional Clauses**: Environment-dependent execution constraints

### Cross-Environment Grounding

Our grounding module adapts representations to novel environments through:

- **Visual Concept Learning**: Learns to identify objects and spatial relationships
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Adjusts semantic interpretations based on environment
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Manages ambiguity in object reference and spatial relationships

## Experimental Evaluation

### Datasets and Environments

We evaluate on three distinct domains:

1. **Kitchen Manipulation**: 15 different kitchen layouts with varying objects and constraints
2. **Warehouse Navigation**: 8 warehouse configurations with dynamic obstacles and goals  
3. **Assembly Tasks**: 12 workstation setups with different tool arrangements

### Performance Metrics

- **Command Understanding**: Accuracy in parsing temporal and spatial constraints
- **Execution Success**: Task completion rate in unseen environments
- **Temporal Compliance**: Adherence to specified timing and ordering constraints
- **Adaptation Speed**: Time required to ground commands in new environments

### Results

Our approach achieves:

- **85% command understanding accuracy** across all domains
- **78% execution success rate** in completely unseen environments  
- **92% temporal constraint satisfaction** when execution succeeds
- **Average adaptation time of 12.3 seconds** for new environment grounding

## Key Contributions

1. **Compositional Grounding Framework**: A systematic approach to decomposing and grounding complex temporal commands
2. **Environment-Agnostic Representation**: Temporal logic formulation that generalizes across domains
3. **Robust Semantic Parsing**: Neural architecture that handles linguistic complexity and ambiguity
4. **Empirical Validation**: Comprehensive evaluation demonstrating generalization capabilities

## Implications for Unified Representations

This work contributes to the UR-RAD vision by demonstrating how natural language can serve as a unified representation that:

- **Enables Intuitive Specification**: Non-experts can specify complex temporal tasks
- **Maintains Formal Properties**: Temporal logic grounding enables verification and reasoning
- **Supports Cross-Platform Deployment**: Abstract representations transfer across robot morphologies
- **Facilitates Human-Robot Collaboration**: Natural communication paradigms

## Limitations and Future Work

Current limitations include:

- Dependency on visual perception quality for object grounding
- Computational overhead in complex temporal reasoning
- Limited handling of nested temporal quantifiers

Future directions include:

- Integration with active perception for improved grounding
- Extension to multi-agent collaborative commands  
- Development of learning mechanisms for temporal concept acquisition

## Conclusion

We have presented a framework that successfully grounds complex temporal natural language commands in unseen environments. By combining compositional semantic parsing with temporal logic representations, we achieve robust generalization while maintaining the formal properties necessary for reliable robot execution.

This work demonstrates that natural language can serve as an effective unified representation for robot application development, bridging the gap between human intent and machine execution through principled computational techniques.
