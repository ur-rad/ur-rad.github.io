title: "PlanOwl: Automated PDDL Files Generation from OWL Ontologies and Visual Language Models"
abstract: "Automated task planning traditionally relies on manually generated domain models, creating bottlenecks in scalability and requiring extensive domain expertise. This paper presents a novel framework to automate the process of generating Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domains and problem files by integrating Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontologies with Visual Language Models (VLMs). Our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of OWL ontologies to systematically define domain classes, predicates, and actions, while VLMs ground abstract ontological concepts in concrete visual observations—automating the generation of instance-specific planning problems. The proposed framework transforms ontological knowledge into PDDL domain files through a mapping algorithm that preserves semantic relationships and logical constraints. The VLM performs visual scene analysis to identify relevant objects, attributes, and spatial configurations for generating initial states, while natural language instructions are used to derive goal states. We evaluate the framework across multiple planning domains, demonstrating that it generates syntactically correct and semantically coherent PDDL domain and problem files directly from OWL ontologies, camera images, and natural language inputs. The resulting files are comparable in quality to those manually generated by planning experts and outperform previous automated systems in terms of semantic fidelity and adaptability."
