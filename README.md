## Site Configuration

- **Main config**: `src/site.config.ts` - Site metadata, navigation, and basic settings
- **Astro config**: `astro.config.ts` - Build settings, integrations, and deployment config
- **Styling**: `src/styles/global.css` - Global styles and CSS variables
- **Content**: Page content is in `src/pages/` with components in `src/components/`

## Key Features

- ðŸš€ **Astro v5** - Fast, modern static site generation
- ðŸŽ¨ **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling with custom design system
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with accessibility in mind
- ðŸŒ“ **Dark/Light Mode** - Automatic theme switching
- ðŸ“„ **SEO Optimized** - Meta tags, sitemap, and social sharing
- ðŸ“Š **Performance Focused** - Optimized builds and fast loading

## Current Architecture

The site is currently built as a single conference website for UR-RAD 2025, with:
- Static pages for main content (Home, Call for Papers, Speakers, etc.)
- Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements
- Asset management for images and media
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Future Multi-Conference Architecture

This repository is being designed to support multiple conference years and venues. See `CONFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed plans on scaling to support:
- Multiple conference years (e.g., `/fss_2025`, `/icra_2026`)
- Shared components and layouts
- Conference-specific content and theming
- Central hub for all UR-RAD events

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process:

1. GitHub Actions builds the site using `npm run build`
2. Generated files in `./dist/` are deployed to the `gh-pages` branch
3. GitHub Pages serves the site from `gh-pages` branch

## Content Management

### Adding New Pages
Create new `.astro` files in `src/pages/` directory. Pages automatically become routes based on file structure.

### Updating Site Information
- **Conference details**: Update `src/site.config.ts`
- **Navigation**: Modify `menuLinks` in `src/site.config.ts`
- **Speakers**: Add images to `src/assets/images/speakers/` and update component
- **Organizers**: Add images to `src/assets/images/organizers/` and update component

### Styling
- **Global styles**: `src/styles/global.css`
- **Component styles**: Use Tailwind classes in `.astro` files
- **Theme colors**: Defined in CSS variables in global styles
