Wider adoption of these representation languages, however, is hindered by the limitations present when managing implicit world changes with concise action models. To address this problem, we propose an alternative approach to representing and managing updates to world states during planning. Based on the category-theoretic concepts of C-sets and double-pushout rewriting (DPO), our proposed representation can effectively handle structured knowledge about world states that support domain abstractions at all levels. It formalizes the semantics of predicates according to a user-provided ontology and preserves the semantics when transitioning between world states. This method provides a formal semantics for using knowledge graphs and relational databases to model world states and updates in planning. In this paper, we conceptually compare our category-theoretic representation with the classical planning representation. We show that our proposed representation has advantages over the classical representation in terms of handling implicit preconditions and effects, and provides a more structured framework in which to model and solve planning problems.",[72,75,79,83,86],{"name":73,"affiliationIndices":74},"Angeline Aguinaldo",[20,24],{"name":76,"affiliationIndices":77},"Evan Patterson",[78],2,{"name":80,"affiliationIndices":81},"James Fairbanks",[82],3,{"name":84,"affiliationIndices":85},"William Regli",[20],{"name":87,"affiliationIndices":88},"Jaime Ruiz",[82],[90,91,92,93],"University of Maryland, College Park","Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory","Topos Institute","University of Florida","https://drive.google.com/file/d/164vE3sixsiWR1AIY5rysK8T0ZfcJ--NH/view",[96,97,98,45,99,100],"categorical-representations","task-planning","knowledge-representation","category-theory","computational-systems",["Date","2023-10-26T10:00:00.000Z"],"src/content/post/categorical-representation-language.md","0be0846d43093801",{"html":50,"metadata":105},{"headings":106,"localImagePaths":107,"remoteImagePaths":108,"frontmatter":109,"imagePaths":124},[],[],[],{"title":69,"abstract":70,"authors":110,"affiliations":121,"tags":122,"publishDate":123,"draft":29,"pdfUrl":94,"readingTime":64},[111,113,115,117,119],{"name":73,"affiliationIndices":112},[20,24],{"name":76,"affiliationIndices":114},[78],{"name":80,"affiliationIndices":116},[82],{"name":84,"affiliationIndices":118},[20],{"name":87,"affiliationIndices":120},[82],[90,91,92,93],[96,97,98,45,99,100],"2023-10-26T10:00:00Z",[],"collision-control-multiple-autonomous-robots",{"id":125,"data":127,"filePath":143,"digest":144,"rendered":145},{"title":128,"abstract":129,"authors":130,"affiliations":134,"pdfUrl":135,"draft":29,"tags":136,"publishDate":142},"A Discussion on the Collision Control of Multiple Autonomous Robots","This paper discusses control methods for multi-agent autonomous robots subject to collision avoidance and unknown external forcing.

Accordingly, there has been a rise in attention to end-user development (EUD) interfaces, which enable non-roboticist end users to specify tasks for autonomous robots to perform. However, state-of-the-art EUD interfaces are often constrained through simplified domains or restrictive end-user interaction. Motivated by our previous qualitative design work that explored how to integrate a care robot in an assisted living community, we discuss the challenges of EUD in this complex domain. One set of challenges stems from different user-facing representations, e.g., certain tasks may lend themselves better to rule-based trigger-action representations, whereas other tasks may be easier to specify via sequences of actions. The other stems from considering the needs of multiple stakeholders, e.g., caregivers and residents of the facility may all create tasks for the robot, but the robot may not be able to share information about all tasks with all residents due to privacy concerns.

In this work, we investigate this by applying an action-conditional prediction algorithm to data collected from a simulated environment, aiming to learn the topology of the environment through sequences of random interactions. Using a simple mobile-robot-like scenario, by leveraging sensory-motor interactions we demonstrate how the agent can discover the topology of its environment. Our results demonstrate the importance of embodiment in the development of representations and potential applicability in robotic tasks, and a simple but effective method of integrating actions into a learning loop.

One of the goals of the Semantic Web is to make knowledge on the Web machine-readable, which can significantly aid robots by providing background knowledge, and thereby support their understanding. In this paper, we present a reasoning system that uses the Ontology for Robotic Knowledge Acquisition (ORKA) to integrate the sensory data and perception algorithms of the robot, thereby enhancing its autonomous capabilities. This reasoning system is subsequently employed to retrieve and integrate information from the Semantic Web, thereby improving the robot’s comprehension of its environment. To achieve this, the system employs a Perceived-Entity Linking (PEL) pipeline that associates regions in the sensory data of the robotic agent with concepts in a target knowledge graph. As a use-case for the linking process, the Perceived-Entity Typing task is used to determine the more fine-grained subclass of the perceived entities. Specifically, we provide an analysis of the performance of different knowledge graph embedding methods on the task using a annotated observations and WikiData as a target knowledge graph. The experiments indicate that relying on pre-trained embedding methods results in an increased performance when using TransE as the embedding method for the observations of the robot.

Unfortunately, online probabilistic planning requires substantial compute resources like time and memory. In cases where the planner must run onboard a consumer robot (e.g., in a household) or in isolated environments (e.g., onboard a ship), the robot may lack sufficient compute resources for online probabilistic planning, thereby necessitating the development of more lightweight solutions.

However, in human-robot collaboration, recognition accuracy for human speech is often influenced by various speech and environmental factors, such as background noise, the speaker’s accents, and mispronunciation. When faced with noisy or unfamiliar auditory inputs, humans use context and prior knowledge to disambiguate the stimulus and take pragmatic actions, a process referred to as top-down processing in cognitive science. We present a cognitively inspired model, Speech Instruction Following through Theory of Mind (SIFToM), to enable robots to pragmatically follow human instructions under diverse speech conditions by inferring the human’s goal and joint plan as prior for speech perception and understanding. We test SIFToM in simulated home experiments (VirtualHome 2).

However, current robot performance is limited to simple tasks in controlled environments. To improve robot autonomy in complex environments, the robot’s deliberation system must be able to synthesise correct plans for a task and generate contingency plans for handling anomalous scenarios that were not expected at design time. The robustness of such a system can be quantified using techniques for formal verification and validation. This paper outlines the progress of EU project CONVINCE (CONtext-aware Verifiable and adaptIve dyNamiC dEliberation), which aims to develop a software toolchain that aids developers in designing, developing, and deploying robot deliberation systems that are fully verified. We describe our modelling approach, each of the toolchain components, and how they interact. We also discuss survey results which demonstrate the demand for a verifiable toolchain among the robotics community.",[1398,1401,1404,1407,1410,1413,1416,1419,1422,1426,1429,1432,1435,1438,1441,1444,1447,1450,1453,1456],{"name":1399,"affiliationIndices":1400},"Charlie Street",[20],{"name":1402,"affiliationIndices":1403},"Yazz Warsame",[20],{"name":1405,"affiliationIndices":1406},"Masoumeh Mansouri",[20],{"name":1408,"affiliationIndices":1409},"Michaela Klauck",[24],{"name":1411,"affiliationIndices":1412},"Christian Henkel",[24],{"name":1414,"affiliationIndices":1415},"Marco Lampacrescia",[24],{"name":1417,"affiliationIndices":1418},"Matteo Palmas",[24,78],{"name":1420,"affiliationIndices":1421},"Ralph Lange",[24],{"name":1423,"affiliationIndices":1424},"Enrico Ghiorzi",[78,1425],5,{"name":1427,"affiliationIndices":1428},"Armando Tacchella",[78],{"name":1430,"affiliationIndices":1431},"Razane Azrou",[82],{"name":1433,"affiliationIndices":1434},"Raphaël Lallement",[82],{"name":1436,"affiliationIndices":1437},"Matteo Morelli",[82],{"name":1439,"affiliationIndices":1440},"Ginny I.
