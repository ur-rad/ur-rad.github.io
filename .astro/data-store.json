By combining compositional semantic parsing with temporal logic representations, we achieve robust generalization while maintaining the formal properties necessary for reliable robot execution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This work demonstrates that natural language can serve as an effective unified representation for robot application development, bridging the gap between human intent and machine execution through principled computational techniques.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Authors\u003C/strong>: Jason Liu¹, Ziyi Yang¹, Ifrah Idrees¹, Sam Liang², Benjamin Schornstein¹, Stefanie Tellex¹, Ankit Shah³\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>¹ Brown University\u003Cbr>\n² MIT\u003Cbr>\n³ University of Southern California\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Conference\u003C/strong>: UR-RAD 2024 - AAAI Fall Symposium on Unifying Representations for Robot Application Development\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Recognition\u003C/strong>: Best Paper Nominee\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>This research exemplifies the integration of natural language processing with formal methods for robust robot task specification and execution.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>",{"headings":117,"localImagePaths":150,"remoteImagePaths":151,"frontmatter":152,"imagePaths":156},[118,119,120,121,124,127,130,133,136,139,140,143,146,149],{"depth":66,"slug":67,"text":68},{"depth":66,"slug":70,"text":71},{"depth":66,"slug":73,"text":74},{"depth":76,"slug":122,"text":123},"compositional-semantic-parsing","Compositional Semantic Parsing",{"depth":76,"slug":125,"text":126},"temporal-logic-representation","Temporal Logic Representation",{"depth":76,"slug":128,"text":129},"cross-environment-grounding","Cross-Environment Grounding",{"depth":66,"slug":131,"text":132},"experimental-evaluation","Experimental Evaluation",{"depth":76,"slug":134,"text":135},"datasets-and-environments","Datasets and Environments",{"depth":76,"slug":137,"text":138},"performance-metrics","Performance Metrics",{"depth":76,"slug":83,"text":84},{"depth":66,"slug":141,"text":142},"key-contributions","Key Contributions",{"depth":66,"slug":144,"text":145},"implications-for-unified-representations","Implications for Unified Representations",{"depth":66,"slug":147,"text":148},"limitations-and-future-work","Limitations and Future Work",{"depth":66,"slug":89,"text":90},[],[],{"title":101,"description":102,"tags":153,"publishDate":154,"draft":16,"readingTime":155},[104,105,106,107,108,109],"2024-11-07T14:30:00Z","4 min read",[]]
