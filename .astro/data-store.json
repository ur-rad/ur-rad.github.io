Let’s get to know each other!  \n\n### What I Can Do \n- Generate code examples in different languages.  \n- Explain how specific lines of code work.  \n- Find bugs and suggest fixes.  \n- Share optimization tips.  \n\n### Code examples\n\n**Python: Factorial Function**\n```python title=\"factorial-function.py\"\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nprint(factorial(5))  # 120\n```  \n*I often help with recursion—classic stuff!*  \n\n**JavaScript: Countdown Timer**\n```js title=\"countdown-timer.js\"\nfunction startTimer(seconds) {\n    let remaining = seconds;\n    const interval = setInterval(() => {\n        console.log(`Time left: ${remaining} sec.`);\n        remaining--;\n        if (remaining \u003C 0) {\n            clearInterval(interval);\n            console.log(\"Time's up! ⏰\");\n        }\n    }, 1000);\n}\n\nstartTimer(5); // Starts a 5-second timer\n```  \n*Async logic? My jam.*  \n\n**SQL: Finding Active Users**\n```sql\nSELECT users.name, COUNT(orders.id) AS total_orders\nFROM users\nLEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id\nGROUP BY users.name\nHAVING total_orders > 3;\n```  \n*I love structured data and elegant JOINs!*  \n\n#### Code optimization: Reducing Time Complexity  \n**Before (O(n²)):**  \n```python\nnumbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]\nduplicates = []\nfor i in range(len(numbers)):\n    for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):\n        if numbers[i] == numbers[j]:\n            duplicates.append(numbers[i])\n```  \n\n**After (O(n)):**  \n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nnumbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]\ncounts = defaultdict(int)\nduplicates = []\nfor num in numbers:\n    if counts[num] > 0:\n        duplicates.append(num)\n    counts[num] += 1\n```  \n*Optimizing code is pure magic!*  \n\n### How I Can Help You\n- **Explain confusing code** from your project.  \n- **Fix memory leaks** in your C++ app.  \n- **Choose the right algorithm** for sorting tasks.  \n- **Write tests** using pytest or Jest.  \n- **Debug \"undefined is not a function\"** in JS.  \n\n### Favorite Topics\n- Machine Learning (PyTorch examples? Sure!).  \n- Web Development (Django, React, Flask).  \n- Algorithms & Data Structures (graphs, trees, hash tables).  \n- Automation with Python (scraping, bots).  \n\n### Pro Tip\n:::tip\nAlways write code comments—they’ll save your teammates *and* your future self. And yes, `console.log` is a temporary fix; tests are better!  \n:::\n\n**Ready to tackle your code!

It supports various formats (TTF, OTF, WOFF, WOFF2) and allows users to optimize web fonts by reducing their size while maintaining essential glyphs.\n\n## Why Use Font Subsetting?\n\nFont files often contain thousands of glyphs, including symbols and characters for multiple languages. Subsetting removes unnecessary glyphs, reducing file size and improving website performance. This is particularly useful when only a specific language set or symbols are needed.\n\nFor example, I encountered an issue when using the SF Pro Rounded font with the Satori library for generating OG images, as described in this post: [Example OG Social Image](posts/social-image/). When using multiple font variants, the project failed to build due to memory overflow errors. Increasing the memory limit did not help. Moreover, using even a single font file larger than ~3.5MB is considered bad practice, let alone multiple variants at the same time.\n\nAfter subsetting the font, I ended up with two subsets, both containing **only Latin characters**: one slightly over 100KB and another around 355KB. This significantly reduced the overall font size while keeping the necessary glyphs.\n\n## Creating a Font Subset with Transfonter\n\nLet's take **SF Pro Rounded**, a multilingual font, and divide it into two subsets:\n\n- **Basic subset**: Includes Latin characters and essential symbols.\n- **Extended subset**: Includes additional glyphs beyond the basic set.\n\n### Upload the Font\n1. Go to [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/).\n2. Click **Add Fonts** and select the **SF Pro Rounded Regular** font file (TTF or OTF format).\n\n### Define Unicode Ranges\nFor subsetting, use the following ranges:\n\n#### Basic Subset\n\ntransfonter.org latin + essential symbols unicode-range:\n```\n0000-007F, 00A0-024F, 2190-22FF, 2934-2937, F6D5-F6D8\n```\n\n#### Extended Subset\n\ntransfonter.org additional glyphs unicode-range:\n```\n0080-00A0, 0250-218F, 2300-FFFF\n```\n\n:::tip\nYou can find out the character codes and view the glyph tables of a font using built-in system tools:\n- Windows: Use Character Map (charmap). Open the Start menu, search for \"Character Map,\" and select a font to see its glyphs and Unicode codes.\n- macOS: Open Font Book, select a font, and switch to \"Repertoire\" mode to see all available characters along with their codes.\n- Linux: Use gucharmap (GNOME Character Map) or kcharselect (for KDE) to browse Unicode symbols in installed fonts.\n:::\n\n### Generate the Font Files\n1. Check the **Subset** box in Transfonter.\n2. Enter the Unicode ranges above for each subset.\n3. Click **Convert** to generate the optimized font files.\n4. Download the converted fonts.\n\n:::tip\nAdditionally, when using Transfonter, you can upload and convert multiple fonts at the same time. The tool allows batch processing, and after conversion, all optimized fonts can be downloaded as a ZIP archive, making it easier to manage multiple font files efficiently.\n:::\n\n### Implement in CSS\nOnce the fonts are ready, use `@font-face` to load them efficiently:\n\n```css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"SFProRounded\";\n  src: url(\"/fonts/SF-Pro-Rounded-Regular-Basic.ttf\") format(\"truetype\");\n  font-weight: 400;\n  font-style: normal;\n}\n\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"SFProRounded\";\n  src: url(\"/fonts/SF-Pro-Rounded-Regular-Extended.ttf\") format(\"truetype\");\n  font-weight: 400;\n  font-style: normal;\n}\n```\n\n### Test the Fonts\nEnsure the fonts load correctly by inspecting network requests in the browser's developer tools. Verify that only necessary subsets are downloaded.\n\n## Conclusion\nUsing Transfonter for font subsetting helps optimize web performance by reducing font file sizes while keeping necessary glyphs. Try it out with your fonts to enhance your website's loading speed!","src/content/post/transfonter.md","7733110d93f491ed",{"html":333,"metadata":334},"\u003Ch2 id=\"what-is-transfonter\">What is Transfonter?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://transfonter.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Transfonter\u003C/a> is a free online tool that helps convert and subset fonts.

that switches from remark (the\nmarkdown ecosystem) to rehype (the HTML ecosystem).\nIt does this by transforming the current markdown (mdast) syntax tree into an\nHTML (hast) syntax tree.\nremark plugins deal with mdast and rehype plugins deal with hast, so plugins\nused after `remark-rehype` have to be rehype plugins.\n\nThe reason that there are different ecosystems for markdown and HTML is that\nturning markdown into HTML is, while frequently needed, not the only purpose of\nmarkdown.\nChecking (linting) and formatting markdown are also common use cases for\nremark and markdown.\nThere are several aspects of markdown that do not translate 1-to-1 to HTML.\nIn some cases markdown contains more information than HTML: for example, there\nare several ways to add a link in markdown (as in, autolinks: `\u003Chttps://url>`,\nresource links: `[label](url)`, and reference links with definitions:\n`[label][id]` and `[id]: url`).\nIn other cases HTML contains more information than markdown: there are many\ntags, which add new meaning (semantics), available in HTML that aren’t available\nin markdown.\nIf there was just one AST, it would be quite hard to perform the tasks that\nseveral remark and rehype plugins currently do.\n\n## When should I use this?\n\nThis project is useful when you want to turn markdown to HTML.\nIt opens up a whole new ecosystem with tons of plugins to do all kinds of\nthings.\nYou can [minify HTML][rehype-minify], [format HTML][rehype-format],\n[make sure it’s safe][rehype-sanitize], [highlight code][rehype-highlight],\n[add metadata][rehype-meta], and a lot more.\n\nA different plugin, [`rehype-raw`][rehype-raw], adds support for raw HTML\nwritten inside markdown.\nThis is a separate plugin because supporting HTML inside markdown is a heavy\ntask (performance and bundle size) and not always needed.\nTo use both together, you also have to configure `remark-rehype` with\n`allowDangerousHtml: true` and then use `rehype-raw`.\n\nThe rehype plugin [`rehype-remark`][rehype-remark] does the inverse of this\nplugin.\nIt turns HTML into markdown.\n\nIf you don’t use plugins and want to access syntax trees, you can use\n[`mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast].\n\n## Install\n\nThis package is [ESM only][esm].\nIn Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:\n\n```sh\nnpm install remark-rehype\n```\n\nIn Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```js\nimport remarkRehype from 'https://esm.sh/remark-rehype@11'\n```\n\nIn browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```html\n\u003Cscript type=\"module\">\n  import remarkRehype from 'https://esm.sh/remark-rehype@11?bundle'\n\u003C/script>\n```\n\n## Use\n\nSay our document `example.md` contains:\n\n```markdown\n# Pluto\n\n**Pluto** (minor-planet designation: **134340 Pluto**) is a\n[dwarf planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet) in the\n[Kuiper belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt).\n```\n\n…and our module `example.js` contains:\n\n```js\nimport rehypeDocument from 'rehype-document'\nimport rehypeFormat from 'rehype-format'\nimport rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'\nimport remarkParse from 'remark-parse'\nimport remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'\nimport {read} from 'to-vfile'\nimport {unified} from 'unified'\nimport {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'\n\nconst file = await unified()\n  .use(remarkParse)\n  .use(remarkRehype)\n  .use(rehypeDocument)\n  .use(rehypeFormat)\n  .use(rehypeStringify)\n  .process(await read('example.md'))\n\nconsole.error(reporter(file))\nconsole.log(String(file))\n```\n\n…then running `node example.js` yields:\n\n```txt\nexample.md: no issues found\n```\n\nHTML:\n\n```html\n\u003C!doctype html>\n\u003Chtml lang=\"en\">\n  \u003Chead>\n    \u003Cmeta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    \u003Ctitle>example\u003C/title>\n    \u003Cmeta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" name=\"viewport\">\n  \u003C/head>\n  \u003Cbody>\n    \u003Ch1>Pluto\u003C/h1>\n    \u003Cp>\n      \u003Cstrong>Pluto\u003C/strong> (minor-planet

identifiers\n[`defaultFootnoteBackContent`][api-default-footnote-back-content],\n[`defaultFootnoteBackLabel`][api-default-footnote-back-label], and\n[`defaultHandlers`][api-default-handlers].\nThe default export is [`remarkRehype`][api-remark-rehype].\n\n### `defaultFootnoteBackContent(referenceIndex, rereferenceIndex)`\n\nSee [`defaultFootnoteBackContent` from\n`mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast-default-footnote-back-content]\n\n### `defaultFootnoteBackLabel(referenceIndex, rereferenceIndex)`\n\nSee [`defaultFootnoteBackLabel` from\n`mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast-default-footnote-back-label]\n\n### `defaultHandlers`\n\nSee [`defaultHandlers` from\n`mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast-default-handlers]\n\n### `unified().use(remarkRehype[, destination][, options])`\n\nTurn markdown into HTML.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n* `destination` ([`Processor`][unified-processor], optional)\n  — processor\n* `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)\n  — configuration\n\n###### Returns\n\nTransform ([`Transformer`][unified-transformer]).\n\n##### Notes\n\n###### Signature\n\n* if a [processor][unified-processor] is given, runs the (rehype) plugins\n  used on it with a hast tree, then discards the result\n  ([*bridge mode*][unified-mode])\n* otherwise, returns a hast tree, the plugins used after `remarkRehype`\n  are rehype plugins ([*mutate mode*][unified-mode])\n\n:::note\nIt’s highly unlikely that you want to pass a `processor`.\n:::\n\n###### HTML\n\nRaw HTML is available in mdast as [`html`][mdast-html] nodes and can be embedded\nin hast as semistandard `raw` nodes.\nMost plugins ignore `raw` nodes but two notable ones don’t:\n\n* [`rehype-stringify`][rehype-stringify] also has an option\n  `allowDangerousHtml` which will output the raw HTML.\n  This is typically discouraged as noted by the option name but is useful if\n  you completely trust authors\n* [`rehype-raw`][rehype-raw] can handle the raw embedded HTML strings by\n  parsing them into standard hast nodes (`element`, `text`, etc).\n  This is a heavy task as it needs a full HTML parser, but it is the only way\n  to support untrusted content\n\n###### Footnotes\n\nMany options supported here relate to footnotes.\nFootnotes are not specified by CommonMark, which we follow by default.\nThey are supported by GitHub, so footnotes can be enabled in markdown with\n[`remark-gfm`][remark-gfm].\n\nThe options `footnoteBackLabel` and `footnoteLabel` define natural language\nthat explains footnotes, which is hidden for sighted users but shown to\nassistive technology.\nWhen your page is not in English, you must define translated values.\n\nBack references use ARIA attributes, but the section label itself uses a\nheading that is hidden with an `sr-only` class.\nTo show it to sighted users, define different attributes in\n`footnoteLabelProperties`.\n\n###### Clobbering\n\nFootnotes introduces a problem, as it links footnote calls to footnote\ndefinitions on the page through `id` attributes generated from user content,\nwhich results in DOM clobbering.\n\nDOM clobbering is this:\n\n```html\n\u003Cp id=x>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cscript>alert(x) // `x` now refers to the DOM `p#x` element\u003C/script>\n```\n\nElements by their ID are made available by browsers on the `window` object,\nwhich is a security risk.\nUsing a prefix solves this problem.\n\nMore information on how to handle clobbering and the prefix is explained in\n[*Example: headings (DOM clobbering)* in\n`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize-clobber].\n\n###### Unknown nodes\n\nUnknown nodes are nodes with a type that isn’t in `handlers` or `passThrough`.\nThe default behavior for unknown nodes is:\n\n* when the node has a `value` (and doesn’t have `data.hName`,\n  `data.hProperties`, or `data.hChildren`, see later), create a hast `text`\n  node\n* otherwise, create a `\u003Cdiv>` element (which could be changed with\n  `data.hName`), with its children mapped from mdast to hast as well\n\nThis behavior can be changed by passing an `unknownHandler`.\n\n### `Options`\n\nConfiguration (TypeScript type).\n\n###### Fields\n\n* `allowDangerousHtml` (`boolean`, default: `false`)\n  — whether to persist raw HTML in markdown in the hast tree\n* `clobberPrefix` (`string`, default: `'user-content-'`)\n  — prefix to use before the `id` property on footnotes to prevent them from\n  *clobbering*\n* `footnoteBackContent`\n  ([`FootnoteBackContentTemplate` from\n  `mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast-footnote-back-content-template]\n  or `string`, default:\n  [`defaultFootnoteBackContent` from\n  `mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast-default-footnote-back-content])\n  — content of the backreference back to references\n* `footnoteBackLabel`\n  ([`FootnoteBackLabelTemplate` from\n  `mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast-footnote-back-label-template]\n  or `string`, default:\n  [`defaultFootnoteBackLabel` from\n  `mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast-default-footnote-back-label])\n  — label to describe the backreference back to references\n* `footnoteLabel` (`string`, default: `'Footnotes'`)\n  — label to use for the footnotes section (affects screen readers)\n* `footnoteLabelProperties`\n  ([`Properties` from `@types/hast`][hast-properties], default:\n  `{className: ['sr-only']}`)\n  — properties to use on the footnote label\n  (note that `id: 'footnote-label'` is always added as footnote calls use it\n  with `aria-describedby` to provide an accessible label)\n* `footnoteLabelTagName` (`string`, default: `h2`)\n  — tag name to use for the footnote label\n* `handlers` ([`Handlers` from\n  `mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast-handlers], optional)\n  — extra handlers for nodes\n* `passThrough` (`Array\u003CNodes['type']>`, optional)\n  — list of custom mdast node types to pass through (keep) in hast (note that\n  the node itself is passed, but eventual children are transformed)\n* `unknownHandler` ([`Handler` from\n  `mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast-handler], optional)\n  — handle all unknown nodes\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example: supporting HTML in markdown naïvely\n\nIf you completely trust the authors of the input markdown and want to allow them\nto write HTML inside markdown, you can pass `allowDangerousHtml` to\n`remark-rehype` and `rehype-stringify`:\n\n```js\nimport rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'\nimport remarkParse from 'remark-parse'\nimport remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'\nimport {unified} from 'unified'\n\nconst file = await unified()\n  .use(remarkParse)\n  .use(remarkRehype, {allowDangerousHtml: true})\n  .use(rehypeStringify, {allowDangerousHtml: true})\n  .process('\u003Ca href=\"/wiki/Dysnomia_(moon)\" onclick=\"alert(1)\">Dysnomia\u003C/a>')\n\nconsole.log(String(file))\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```html\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/wiki/Dysnomia_(moon)\" onclick=\"alert(1)\">Dysnomia\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n```\n\n:::caution\nОbserve that the XSS attack through `onclick` is present.\n:::\n\n### Example: supporting HTML in markdown properly\n\nIf you do not trust the authors of the input markdown, or if you want to make\nsure that rehype plugins can see HTML embedded in markdown, use\n[`rehype-raw`][rehype-raw].\nThe following example passes `allowDangerousHtml` to `remark-rehype`, then\nturns the raw embedded HTML into proper HTML nodes with `rehype-raw`, and\nfinally sanitizes the HTML by only allowing safe things with\n`rehype-sanitize`:\n\n```js\nimport rehypeSanitize from 'rehype-sanitize'\nimport rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'\nimport rehypeRaw from 'rehype-raw'\nimport remarkParse from 'remark-parse'\nimport remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'\nimport {unified} from 'unified'\n\nconst file = await unified()\n  .use(remarkParse)\n  .use(remarkRehype, {allowDangerousHtml: true})\n  .use(rehypeRaw)\n  .use(rehypeSanitize)\n  .use(rehypeStringify)\n  .process('\u003Ca href=\"/wiki/Dysnomia_(moon)\" onclick=\"alert(1)\">Dysnomia\u003C/a>')\n\nconsole.log(String(file))\n```\n\nRunning that code yields:\n\n```html\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/wiki/Dysnomia_(moon)\">Dysnomia\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n```\n\n:::caution\nОbserve that the XSS attack through `onclick` is **not** present.\n:::\n\n### Example: footnotes in languages other than English\n\nIf you know that the markdown is authored in a language other than English,\nand you’re using `remark-gfm` to match how GitHub renders markdown, and you know\nthat footnotes are (or can?) be used, you should translate the labels associated\nwith them.\n\nLet’s first set the stage:\n\n```js\nimport {unified} from 'unified'\nimport remarkParse from 'remark-parse'\nimport remarkGfm from

transformed to hast (HTML).\n\n## CSS\n\nAssuming you know how to use (semantic) HTML and CSS, then it should generally\nbe straightforward to style the HTML produced by this plugin.\nWith CSS, you can get creative and style the results as you please.\n\nSome semistandard features, notably GFMs tasklists and footnotes, generate HTML\nthat be unintuitive, as it matches exactly what GitHub produces for their\nwebsite.\nThere is a project, [`sindresorhus/github-markdown-css`][github-markdown-css],\nthat exposes the stylesheet that GitHub uses for rendered markdown, which might\neither be inspirational for more complex features, or can be used as-is to\nexactly match how GitHub styles rendered markdown.\n\nThe following CSS is needed to make footnotes look a bit like GitHub:\n\n```css\n/* Style the footnotes section. */\n.footnotes {\n  font-size: smaller;\n  color: #8b949e;\n  border-top: 1px solid #30363d;\n}\n\n/* Hide the section label for visual users. */\n.sr-only {\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 1px;\n  height: 1px;\n  padding: 0;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);\n  word-wrap: normal;\n  border: 0;\n}\n\n/* Place `[` and `]` around footnote calls. */\n[data-footnote-ref]::before {\n  content: '[';\n}\n\n[data-footnote-ref]::after {\n  content: ']';\n}\n```\n\n## Syntax tree\n\nThis projects turns [mdast][] (markdown) into [hast][] (HTML).\n\nIt extends mdast by supporting `data` fields on mdast nodes to specify how they\nshould be transformed.\nSee [*Fields on nodes* in\n`mdast-util-to-hast`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-to-hast#fields-on-nodes)\nfor info on how these fields work.\n\nIt extends hast by using a semistandard raw nodes for raw HTML.\nSee the [*HTML* note above](#html) for more info.\n\n## Types\n\nThis package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].\nIt exports the types\n[`Options`][api-options].\n\nThe types of `mdast-util-to-hast` can be referenced to register data fields\nwith `@types/mdast` and `Raw` nodes with `@types/hast`.\n\n```js\n/**\n * @import {Root as HastRoot} from 'hast'\n * @import {Root as MdastRoot} from 'mdast'\n * @import {} from 'mdast-util-to-hast'\n */\n\nimport {visit} from 'unist-util-visit'\n\nconst mdastNode = /** @type {MdastRoot} */ ({/* … */})\nconsole.log(mdastNode.data?.hName) // Typed as `string | undefined`.\n\nconst hastNode = /** @type {HastRoot} */ ({/* … */})\n\nvisit(hastNode, function (node) {\n  // `node` can now be `raw`.\n})\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nProjects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained\nversions of Node.js.\n\nWhen we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of\nNode.\nThis means we try to keep the current release line, `remark-rehype@^11`,\ncompatible with Node.js 16.\n\nThis plugin works with `unified` version 6+, `remark-parse` version 3+ (used in\n`remark` version 7), and `rehype-stringify` version 3+ (used in `rehype`\nversion 5).\n\n## Security\n\nUse of `remark-rehype` can open you up to a\n[cross-site scripting (XSS)][wiki-xss] attack.\nEmbedded **[hast][]** properties (`hName`, `hProperties`, `hChildren`) in\n[mdast][], custom handlers, and the `allowDangerousHtml` option all provide\nopenings.\nUse [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.\n\n##

package is a \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unified\u003C/a> (\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remark\u003C/a>) plugin that switches from remark (the\nmarkdown ecosystem) to rehype (the HTML ecosystem).\nIt does this by transforming the current markdown (mdast) syntax tree into an\nHTML (hast) syntax tree.\nremark plugins deal with mdast and rehype plugins deal with hast, so plugins\nused after \u003Ccode>remark-rehype\u003C/code> have to be rehype plugins.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The reason that there are different ecosystems for markdown and HTML is that\nturning markdown into HTML is, while frequently needed, not the only purpose of\nmarkdown.\nChecking (linting) and formatting markdown are also common use cases for\nremark and markdown.\nThere are several aspects of markdown that do not translate 1-to-1 to HTML.\nIn some cases markdown contains more information than HTML: for example, there\nare several ways to add a link in markdown (as in, autolinks: \u003Ccode>&#x3C;https://url>\u003C/code>,\nresource links: \u003Ccode>[label](url)\u003C/code>, and reference links with definitions:\n\u003Ccode>[label][id]\u003C/code> and \u003Ccode>[id]: url\u003C/code>).\nIn other cases HTML contains more information than markdown: there are many\ntags, which add new meaning (semantics), available in HTML that aren’t available\nin markdown.\nIf there was just one AST, it would be quite hard to perform the tasks that\nseveral remark and rehype plugins currently do.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"when-should-i-use-this\">When should I use this?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This project is useful when you want to turn markdown to HTML.\nIt opens up a whole new ecosystem with tons of plugins to do all kinds of\nthings.\nYou can \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">minify HTML\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">format HTML\u003C/a>,\n\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">make sure it’s safe\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">highlight code\u003C/a>,\n\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-meta\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">add metadata\u003C/a>, and a lot more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A different plugin, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u003Ccode>rehype-raw\u003C/code>\u003C/a>, adds support for raw HTML\nwritten inside markdown.\nThis is a separate plugin because supporting HTML inside markdown is a heavy\ntask (performance and bundle size) and not always needed.\nTo use both together, you also have to configure \u003Ccode>remark-rehype\u003C/code> with\n\u003Ccode>allowDangerousHtml: true\u003C/code> and then use \u003Ccode>rehype-raw\u003C/code>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The rehype plugin \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-remark\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"

Add a link on your homepage to either your GitHub profile and/or email address as per [IndieLogin's](https://indielogin.com/setup) instructions. You _could_ do this via `src/components/SocialList.astro`, just be sure to include `isWebmention` to the relevant link if doing so.\n2. Create an account @ [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) by entering your website's address.\n3. Add the link feed and api key to a `.env` file with the key `WEBMENTION_URL` and `WEBMENTION_API_KEY` respectively, you could rename `.env.example` found in this template. You can also add the optional `WEBMENTION_PINGBACK` link here too.\n4. Go to [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/) and sign-in to each social account[s] you wish to link.\n5. Publish and build your website, remember to add the api key, and it should now be ready to receive webmentions!\n\n## What are webmentions\n\nPut simply, it's a way to show users who like, comment, repost and more, on various pages on your website via social media.\n\nThis theme displays the number of likes, mentions and replies each blog post receives. There are a couple of more webmentions that I haven't included, like reposts, which are currently filtered out, but shouldn't be too difficult to include.\n\n## Steps to add it to your own site\n\nYour going to have to create a couple of accounts to get things up-and-running. But, the first thing you need to ensure is that your social links are correct.\n\n### Add link(s) to your profile(s)\n\nFirstly, you need to add a link on your site to prove ownership. If you have a look at [IndieLogin's](https://indielogin.com/setup) instructions, it gives you 2 options, either an email address and/or GitHub account. I've created the component `src/components/SocialList.astro` where you can add your details into the `socialLinks` array, just include the `isWebmention` property to the relevant link which will add the `rel=\"me authn\"` attribute. Whichever way you do it, make sure you have a link in your markup as per IndieLogin's [instructions](https://indielogin.com/setup)\n\n```html\n\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/your-username\" rel=\"me\">GitHub\u003C/a>\n```\n\n### Sign up to Webmention.io\n\nNext, head over to [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) and create an account by signing in with your domain name, e.g. `http://astrocitrus.artemkutsan.pp.ua/`. Please note that .app TLDs don't function correctly. Once in, it will give you a couple of links for your domain to accept webmentions. Make a note of these and create a `.env` file (this template include an example `.env.example` which you could rename). Add the link feed and api key with the key/values of `WEBMENTION_URL` and `WEBMENTION_API_KEY` respectively, and the optional `WEBMENTION_PINGBACK` url if required. Please try not to publish this to a repository!\n\n:::note\nYou don't have to include the pingback link. Maybe coincidentally, but after adding it I started to receive a higher frequency of spam in my mailbox, informing me that my website could be better. TBH they're not wrong. I've now removed it, but it's up to you.\n:::\n\n### Sign up to Brid.gy\n\nYou're now going to have to use [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/). As the name suggests, it links your website to your social media accounts. For every account you want to set up (e.g. Mastodon), click on the relevant button and connect each account you want brid.gy to search. Just to note again, brid.gy currently has an issue with .app TLDs.\n\n## Testing everything works\n\nWith everything set, it's now time to build and publish your website. **REMEMBER** to set your environment variables `WEBMENTION_API_KEY` & `WEBMENTION_URL` with your host.\n\nYou can check to see if everything is working by sending a test webmention via [webmentions.rocks](https://webmention.rocks/receive/1). Log in with your domain, enter the auth code, and then the url of the page you want to test. For example, to test this page I would add `http://astrocitrus.artemkutsan.pp.ua/posts/webmentions/`. To view it on your website, rebuild or (re)start dev mode locally, and you should see the result at the bottom of your page.\n\nYou can also view any test mentions in the browser via their [api](https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api).\n\n## Things to add, things to consider\n\n- At the moment, fresh webmentions are only fetched on a rebuild or restarting dev mode, which obviously means if you don't update your site very often you wont get a lot of new content. It should be quite trivial to add a cron job to run the `getAndCacheWebmentions()` function in `src/utils/webmentions.ts` and populate your blog with new content. This is probably what I'll add next as a github action.\n\n- I have seen some mentions have duplicates. Unfortunately, they're quite difficult to filter out as they have different id's.\n\n- I'm not a huge fan of the little external link icon for linking to comments/replies. It's not particularly great on mobile due to its size, and will likely change it in the future.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nMany thanks to [Kieran McGuire](https://github.com/KieranMaguire) for the helpful posts. I'd never heard of webmentions before, and now with this update hopefully others will be able to make use of them. Additionally, articles and examples from [kld](https://kld.dev/adding-webmentions/) and [ryanmulligan.dev](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/) really helped in getting this set up and integrated, both a great resource if you're looking for more information!","src/content/post/webmentions.md","e4c08e14c18832ad",{"html":591,"metadata":592},"\u003Ch2 id=\"tldr\">TLDR\u003C/h2>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>Add a link on your homepage to either your GitHub profile and/or email address as per \u003Ca href=\"https://indielogin.com/setup\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IndieLogin’s\u003C/a> instructions.

This allows for easy changes to the entire theme's color palette by adjusting just one parameter.\n\n2. **Unified Logic for Light and Dark Themes**\n   - Different brightness and saturation parameters are defined in `:root[data-theme=\"light\"]` and `:root[data-theme=\"dark\"]`, but the logic remains consistent.\n   - For example, in the light theme, the background is lighter (`--bg-brightness: 95%`), and in the dark theme, it is darker (`--bg-brightness: 17%`).\n\n3. **Creating Color Gradients**\n   - A gradient scale (`--theme-color-950` → `--theme-color-50`) is used to generate shades of a single color.\n   - This allows for dynamically generated variations of colors for backgrounds, text, and accents without manual input.\n\n4. **Defining Key UI Elements**\n   - `--theme-bg` — background color\n   - `--theme-accent-two`, `--theme-accent-base` — accent colors\n   - `--theme-text` — main text color\n   - `--theme-link` — link color\n   - `--theme-quote` — quote color\n\n```css title=\"globas.css\"\n@layer base {\n\t:root,\n\t:root[data-theme=\"light\"] {\n\t\tcolor-scheme: light;\n\n\t\t/*** MAIN COLORS (Base, Background, Accents, Text) ***/\n\t\t/* Base theme hue color */\n\t\t--hue: 200deg;

**Create the `.local.gitignore` file**  \n   ```bash\n   touch .local.gitignore\n   ```\n\n2. **Add it to `.git/info/exclude`** (so Git applies it locally)  \n   ```bash\n   echo \".local.gitignore\" >> .git/info/exclude\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure Git to treat `.local.gitignore` as `.gitignore`**  \n   ```bash\n   git config --local core.excludesfile .local.gitignore\n   ```\n\nNow **`.local.gitignore` will work like a regular `.gitignore`, but only for you**.  \n\n## How does it work?\n- `.local.gitignore` is not added to the repository.  \n- It is applied **only locally** on your computer.  \n- It works **like `.gitignore`**, but other developers don't have it.  \n- Git **does not see this file** thanks to `.git/info/exclude`.  \n\n**Now you can add local files to it**:  \n```bash\necho \"my-secret-file.txt\" >> .local.gitignore\necho \"debug_logs/\" >> .local.gitignore\n```\n\n:::caution\nBefore performing a commit rollback, you must manually backup the files listed in `.local.gitignore`. This is because files ignored by `.local.gitignore` are not tracked by Git and will be lost if you rollback the commit.
