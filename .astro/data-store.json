Wider adoption of these representation languages, however, is hindered by the limitations present when managing implicit world changes with concise action models. To address this problem, we propose an alternative approach to representing and managing updates to world states during planning. Based on the category-theoretic concepts of C-sets and double-pushout rewriting (DPO), our proposed representation can effectively handle structured knowledge about world states that support domain abstractions at all levels. It formalizes the semantics of predicates according to a user-provided ontology and preserves the semantics when transitioning between world states. This method provides a formal semantics for using knowledge graphs and relational databases to model world states and updates in planning. In this paper, we conceptually compare our category-theoretic representation with the classical planning representation. We show that our proposed representation has advantages over the classical representation in terms of handling implicit preconditions and effects, and provides a more structured framework in which to model and solve planning problems.",[72,75,79,83,86],{"name":73,"affiliationIndices":74},"Angeline Aguinaldo",[20,24],{"name":76,"affiliationIndices":77},"Evan Patterson",[78],2,{"name":80,"affiliationIndices":81},"James Fairbanks",[82],3,{"name":84,"affiliationIndices":85},"William Regli",[20],{"name":87,"affiliationIndices":88},"Jaime Ruiz",[82],[90,91,92,93],"University of Maryland, College Park","Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory","Topos Institute","University of Florida","https://drive.google.com/file/d/164vE3sixsiWR1AIY5rysK8T0ZfcJ--NH/view",[96,97,98,45,99,100],"categorical-representations","task-planning","knowledge-representation","category-theory","computational-systems",["Date","2023-10-26T10:00:00.000Z"],"src/content/post/categorical-representation-language.md","0be0846d43093801",{"html":50,"metadata":105},{"headings":106,"localImagePaths":107,"remoteImagePaths":108,"frontmatter":109,"imagePaths":124},[],[],[],{"title":69,"abstract":70,"authors":110,"affiliations":121,"tags":122,"publishDate":123,"draft":29,"pdfUrl":94,"readingTime":64},[111,113,115,117,119],{"name":73,"affiliationIndices":112},[20,24],{"name":76,"affiliationIndices":114},[78],{"name":80,"affiliationIndices":116},[82],{"name":84,"affiliationIndices":118},[20],{"name":87,"affiliationIndices":120},[82],[90,91,92,93],[96,97,98,45,99,100],"2023-10-26T10:00:00Z",[],"collision-control-multiple-autonomous-robots",{"id":125,"data":127,"filePath":143,"digest":144,"rendered":145},{"title":128,"abstract":129,"authors":130,"affiliations":134,"pdfUrl":135,"draft":29,"tags":136,"publishDate":142},"A Discussion on the Collision Control of Multiple Autonomous Robots","This paper discusses control methods for multi-agent autonomous robots subject to collision avoidance and unknown external forcing.

Accordingly, there has been a rise in attention to end-user development (EUD) interfaces, which enable non-roboticist end users to specify tasks for autonomous robots to perform. However, state-of-the-art EUD interfaces are often constrained through simplified domains or restrictive end-user interaction. Motivated by our previous qualitative design work that explored how to integrate a care robot in an assisted living community, we discuss the challenges of EUD in this complex domain. One set of challenges stems from different user-facing representations, e.g., certain tasks may lend themselves better to rule-based trigger-action representations, whereas other tasks may be easier to specify via sequences of actions. The other stems from considering the needs of multiple stakeholders, e.g., caregivers and residents of the facility may all create tasks for the robot, but the robot may not be able to share information about all tasks with all residents due to privacy concerns.

In this work, we investigate this by applying an action-conditional prediction algorithm to data collected from a simulated environment, aiming to learn the topology of the environment through sequences of random interactions. Using a simple mobile-robot-like scenario, by leveraging sensory-motor interactions we demonstrate how the agent can discover the topology of its environment. Our results demonstrate the importance of embodiment in the development of representations and potential applicability in robotic tasks, and a simple but effective method of integrating actions into a learning loop.

One of the goals of the Semantic Web is to make knowledge on the Web machine-readable, which can significantly aid robots by providing background knowledge, and thereby support their understanding. In this paper, we present a reasoning system that uses the Ontology for Robotic Knowledge Acquisition (ORKA) to integrate the sensory data and perception algorithms of the robot, thereby enhancing its autonomous capabilities. This reasoning system is subsequently employed to retrieve and integrate information from the Semantic Web, thereby improving the robot’s comprehension of its environment. To achieve this, the system employs a Perceived-Entity Linking (PEL) pipeline that associates regions in the sensory data of the robotic agent with concepts in a target knowledge graph. As a use-case for the linking process, the Perceived-Entity Typing task is used to determine the more fine-grained subclass of the perceived entities. Specifically, we provide an analysis of the performance of different knowledge graph embedding methods on the task using a annotated observations and WikiData as a target knowledge graph. The experiments indicate that relying on pre-trained embedding methods results in an increased performance when using TransE as the embedding method for the observations of the robot.

Unfortunately, online probabilistic planning requires substantial compute resources like time and memory. In cases where the planner must run onboard a consumer robot (e.g., in a household) or in isolated environments (e.g., onboard a ship), the robot may lack sufficient compute resources for online probabilistic planning, thereby necessitating the development of more lightweight solutions.

However, in human-robot collaboration, recognition accuracy for human speech is often influenced by various speech and environmental factors, such as background noise, the speaker’s accents, and mispronunciation. When faced with noisy or unfamiliar auditory inputs, humans use context and prior knowledge to disambiguate the stimulus and take pragmatic actions, a process referred to as top-down processing in cognitive science. We present a cognitively inspired model, Speech Instruction Following through Theory of Mind (SIFToM), to enable robots to pragmatically follow human instructions under diverse speech conditions by inferring the human’s goal and joint plan as prior for speech perception and understanding. We test SIFToM in simulated home experiments (VirtualHome 2).

However, current robot performance is limited to simple tasks in controlled environments. To improve robot autonomy in complex environments, the robot’s deliberation system must be able to synthesise correct plans for a task and generate contingency plans for handling anomalous scenarios that were not expected at design time. The robustness of such a system can be quantified using techniques for formal verification and validation.

In this paper, we argue that robotic middleware can serve important roles for robotic architectures, in particular, cognitive robotic architecture, if the right kinds of interfaces are provided that allow for a tight integration between architecture and middleware. We introduce the Thinking Robots Agent Development Environment, TRADE, which is an extension of the previous Agent Development Environment, ADE, and provides advanced features for architecture integration and interactions between cognitive robotic architecture and the middleware layer. We describe several features in TRADE that are missing in ROS, in particular, system-wide locking mechanisms, service instrumentation, and middleware service calls and discuss how they can support the architecture developers with implementing advanced architectural features such as dialogue-based system debugging and configuration, or multi-effector multi-robot behavior coordination.",[1534],{"name":1535,"affiliationIndices":1536},"Matthias Scheutz",[20],[1538],"Tufts University","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XJnh8DWebOUyA_eLpb_4kS5CS8Jp5_qC/view",[1541,1542,1543,279],"middleware","architecture","debugging",["Date","2025-11-06T11:00:00.000Z"],"src/content/post/trade-middleware-advanced-robotics.md","50e31759587778c4",{"html":50,"metadata":1548},{"headings":1549,"localImagePaths":1550,"remoteImagePaths":1551,"frontmatter":1552,"imagePaths":1559},[],[],[],{"title":1531,"abstract":1532,"authors":1553,"affiliations":1556,"tags":1557,"publishDate":1558,"draft":29,"pdfUrl":1539,"readingTime":64},[1554],{"name":1535,"affiliationIndices":1555},[20],[1538],[1541,1542,1543,279],"2025-11-06T11:00:00Z",[],"developing-robot-grasping-guidelines",{"id":1560,"data":1562,"filePath":1586,"digest":1587,"rendered":1588},{"title":1563,"abstract":1564,"authors":1565,"affiliations":1578,"pdfUrl":1580,"draft":29,"tags":1581,"publishDate":1585},"Towards Developing Standards and Guidelines for Robot Grasping and Manipulation Pipelines in the COMPARE Ecosystem","The COMPARE Ecosystem aims to improve the compatibility and benchmarking of open-source products for robot manipulation through a series of activities.

This unified abstraction allows high-level systems to issue commands in a flexible format that accommodates multi-modal inputs such as optimized trajectories, motion capture clips, re-targeted video, and real-time joystick signals. The MHC is trained in simulation using a curriculum that spans this full range of modalities, enabling robust execution of partially specified behaviors while maintaining balance and disturbance rejection.

The system is evaluated in two environments: a simple obstacle field, where the drone achieves a 100% success rate (112/112 episodes), and a densely cluttered map, where it reaches the target in 35% of trials (7/20).

This paper presents a novel framework to automate the process of generating Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domains and problem files by integrating Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontologies with Visual Language Models (VLMs). Our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of OWL ontologies to systematically define domain classes, predicates, and actions, while VLMs ground abstract ontological concepts in concrete visual observations—automating the generation of instance-specific planning problems. The proposed framework transforms ontological knowledge into PDDL domain files through a mapping algorithm that preserves semantic relationships and logical constraints. The VLM performs visual scene analysis to identify relevant objects, attributes, and spatial configurations for generating initial states, while natural language instructions are used to derive goal states. We evaluate the framework across multiple planning domains, demonstrating that it generates syntactically correct and semantically coherent PDDL domain and problem files directly from OWL ontologies, camera images, and natural language inputs. The resulting files are comparable in quality to those manually generated by planning experts and outperform previous automated systems in terms of semantic fidelity and adaptability.",[1776,1778],{"name":755,"affiliationIndices":1777},[20],{"name":1779,"affiliationIndices":1780},"Paolo Forte",[24],[767,1782],"Orebro University","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wypf_HMbWtH0UomwhYjXjNLvDnneVYNS/view",[399,1717,1752,392],["Date","2025-11-06T11:00:00.000Z"],"src/content/post/plan-owl-automated-pddl.md","1d9df91b9338148d",{"html":50,"metadata":1789},{"headings":1790,"localImagePaths":1791,"remoteImagePaths":1792,"frontmatter":1793,"imagePaths":1801},[],[],[],{"title":1773,"abstract":1774,"authors":1794,"affiliations":1799,"tags":1800,"publishDate":1558,"draft":29,"pdfUrl":1783,"readingTime":64},[1795,1797],{"name":755,"affiliationIndices":1796},[20],{"name":1779,"affiliationIndices":1798},[24],[767,1782],[399,1717,1752,392],[],"statistical-agent-based-model",{"id":1802,"data":1804,"filePath":1818,"digest":1819,"rendered":1820},{"title":1805,"abstract":1806,"authors":1807,"affiliations":1811,"pdfUrl":1813,"draft":29,"tags":1814,"publishDate":1817},"A Statistical Agent-Based Model Of Development And Evaluation","This paper describes a prospective, preference-driven, practical model that may have useful systems engineering applications.

Harnessing signals such as gestures may expedite robot exploration in large, outdoor urban environments for supporting disaster recovery operations, where speech may be unclear due to noise or the challenges of a dynamic and dangerous environment. Despite this potential, capturing human gesture and properly grounding it to crowded, outdoor environments remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a method to model human gesture and ground it to spoken language instructions given to a robot for execution in large spaces. We implement our method in virtual reality to develop a workflow for faster future data collection. We present a series of proposed experiments that compare a language-only baseline to our proposed language supplemented by gesture approach, and discuss how our approach has the potential to reinforce the human’s intent and detect discrepancies in gesture and spoken instructions in these large and crowded environments.",[1882,1885,1888,1891],{"name":1883,"affiliationIndices":1884},"Padraig\tHiggins",[20],{"name":1886,"affiliationIndices":1887},"Cory\tHayes",[24],{"name":1889,"affiliationIndices":1890},"Stephanie\tLukin",[24],{"name":1892,"affiliationIndices":1893},"Cynthia\tMatuszek",[20],[1895,1896],"University of Maryland","Army Research Lab","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GEvchCIvUcA2Chep6IcTJ9Qtk3mOI8Uk/view",[1899,1900,1901],"gesture","virtual reality","language",["Date","2025-11-06T11:00:00.000Z"],"src/content/post/language-gesture-virtual-reality.md","969408ee7e0b3053",{"html":50,"metadata":1906},{"headings":1907,"localImagePaths":1908,"remoteImagePaths":1909,"frontmatter":1910,"imagePaths":1922},[],[],[],{"title":1879,"abstract":1880,"authors":1911,"affiliations":1920,"tags":1921,"publishDate":1558,"draft":29,"pdfUrl":1897,"readingTime":64},[1912,1914,1916,1918],{"name":1883,"affiliationIndices":1913},[20],{"name":1886,"affiliationIndices":1915},[24],{"name":1889,"affiliationIndices":1917},[24],{"name":1892,"affiliationIndices":1919},[20],[1895,1896],[1899,1900,1901],[],"vizij-design-animation-deployment-faces",{"id":1923,"data":1925,"filePath":1956,"digest":1957,"rendered":1958},{"title":1926,"abstract":1927,"authors":1928,"affiliations":1948,"pdfUrl":1950,"draft":29,"tags":1951,"publishDate":1955},"Vizij: Supporting the design, animation, and deployment of rendered robot faces","The lack of a standardized, open-source platform for expressive, rendered robot faces is hindering effective human-robot interaction (HRI).

However, perceptions of the users greatly affect the acceptability of such robots. Ability of the system to understand user’s perception of the physical interaction as well as adapting robot’s behaviors based on user perception and interaction context can facilitate acceptability of these robots. In this paper we propose a perception-based interaction adaptation framework. One main component of this framework is a multi-modal perception model which is grounded on the existing literature and is intended to provide a quantitative estimation of the human state- defined as the perceptions of the physical interaction- by using human, robot, and context information. This model is intended to be comprehensive in many physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) scenarios. The estimated human state is fed to a context-aware behavior adaptation framework which recommends robot behaviors to improve human state using a learned behavior cost model and an optimization formulation. We show the potential and feasibility of such a human state estimation model by evaluating a reduced model, with data collected through a user study. Additionally, through some feature analysis, we aimed to shed light on future interaction designs for pHRI.",[1988,1990],{"name":577,"affiliationIndices":1989},[20],{"name":1991,"affiliationIndices":1992},"Rana Soltani Zarrin",[24],[1994,1995],"The Robotics Institute","Honda Research Institute","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-uPRSets6ctIk6BSHXdowoSnMrPW71_/view",[1998,1999,2000,2001],"touch","physical","multi-modal","improvement",["Date","2025-11-06T11:00:00.000Z"],"src/content/post/multi-modal-robotic-touch.md","d0e6fb40de76c932",{"html":50,"metadata":2006},{"headings":2007,"localImagePaths":2008,"remoteImagePaths":2009,"frontmatter":2010,"imagePaths":2018},[],[],[],{"title":1985,"abstract":1986,"authors":2011,"affiliations":2016,"tags":2017,"publishDate":1558,"draft":29,"pdfUrl":1996,"readingTime":64},[2012,2014],{"name":577,"affiliationIndices":2013},[20],{"name":1991,"affiliationIndices":2015},[24],[1994,1995],[1998,1999,2000,2001],[],"series",["Map",2021,2022,2036,2037],"citrus-docs",{"id":2021,"data":2023,"filePath":2027,"digest":2028,"rendered":2029},{"id":2021,"title":2024,"description":2025,"featured":2026},"Citrus Docs","Astro Citrus documentation outlines key aspects of the template, describing its core functionality for blog management and project documentation setup",true,"src/content/series/citrus-docs.md","9587a82953734c4c",{"html":50,"metadata":2030},{"headings":2031,"localImagePaths":2032,"remoteImagePaths":2033,"frontmatter":2034,"imagePaths":2035},[],[],[],{"id":2021,"title":2024,"description":2025,"featured":2026,"readingTime":64},[],"markdown-elements",{"id":2036,"data":2038,"filePath":2041,"digest":2042,"rendered":2043},{"id":2036,"title":2039,"description":2040,"featured":29},"Markdown Elements","Dive into a comprehensive guide exploring Markdown syntax and elements, from basic formatting to advanced features, designed to help you master their usage with practical examples for enhancing your documentation and writing efficiency","src/content/series/markdown-elements.md","6fb3819652d108bb",{"html":50,"metadata":2044},{"headings":2045,"localImagePaths":2046,"remoteImagePaths":2047,"frontmatter":2048,"imagePaths":2049},[],[],[],{"id":2036,"title":2039,"description":2040,"readingTime":64},[]]
